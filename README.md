MathQuest is an educational Android application designed with a primary focus for students with a beginner-level
status in mathematics.

Vision Statement:
 Our mission is to develop an educational oriented android application, that provides an exciting alternative to common learning practices, while also effectively enhancing the users’ math skills.

Following these set of instructions can lead to successfully compiling and running the application:

1.  First you need to have installed Android studio application by Google on your computer. If previously installed go to step 2, otherwise, you can download from this given link where it comes with all the bundle needed to run the applications.
https://developer.android.com/studio

2.  Once the download is complete, please install the application by accepting the license.


3.  When the installation is complete, it will open the first window asking whether you want to create a new project or open a previous project. If you don't want to create a new
project, go to step 5.

4.  If you select the new project, it will prompt for activity to Select > Press Next > give the
information about application like name, language want to use either java or kotlin >
Press Finish > Create the new project.

5.  Then visit the Github repository of Mathquest by clicking this link:
https://github.com/mohankarki54/MathQuest . On the upper right of the screen, you will see the clone or download and when you click on it, the dialog box will appear. Download the zip folder and unzip it. If you are using Mac OS, simply double click on the folder then it will be unzipped and if you are using windows os then, you can unzipped by right click on folder and unzip form the option provided.

6.  Go to the window of the Android studio and select open the existing project folder > select the folder > Open it. If you have already created a project then go the file and open the folder in the current window or new window as per the prompt provided there.

7.  After you open the project, simply let the application sync the project and wait for some time until there shows the message, build successfully, no error found.

8.  In order to run the application, you need to create the virtual emulator or have an actual physical device. If you have the physical device then go to the setting and turn on the developer mode and then debugging mode on too. In order to create the virtual emulator,

following these steps: Tools > AVD Manager > Create Virtual Machine > Select Device
> Select OS and Download it > Press Finish.

9. If you are using the Windows OS then you need to enable emulator in the BIOS setting
which you can be do by visiting this tutorial:

10. In order to just to compile the project, go to Build > Build project but in we can compile
by building project and run project at once and it can be done by Run > Run ‘app’. Also, there is the button next to the device name in the toolbar to build and run the project. If the physical device is being plugged, then its name will be shown there else the virtual box name is shown.

11. Once the app is successfully run on your selected device, then you browse the exciting features of our application.
Test Case Instructions

Currently we have these four unit tests for our application. Follow these instructions in order to successfully execute:

1. On the upper left, go to App > java > mohankarki.mathquest (test) > right click calculationTest.

2. Upon right click, it will display the option, then press Run ‘calculationTest’ and it will validate the unit function of our program.
